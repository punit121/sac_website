<p class="col3_font"> Students' Alumni Cell works in conjunction with the student administration bodies and is therefore constantly in touch with the needs and wants of the students.
It connects the students with the alumni, giving them a chance to interact with some of the most eminent personalities in all fields of work.
The My Imprint program provides the departing students with an opportunity to make a difference in the institute.
Guest lectures organised by Students' Alumni Cell bring them up to date with the workings of the real world. 
Students thus directly get to learn from alumni who have faced the trials of life.</p>

<p class="col3_font"> The Students’ Alumni Cell works towards ensuring mutual benefit of the Students as well as the Alumni.
The cell helps the alumni in staying connected to the institute. Through regular interactions with the next generation of KGPians, 
the alumni too get to learn a lot as learning is a continuous process and each generation has their own set of skills to boast of. 
The cell’s efforts keeps the ever-growing pool of bright, young KGPian minds at hand’s reach of the alumni for them to choose if and when they 
require for any of their corporate endeavours. The Students’ Alumni Cell strives to rekindle those memories, revive that unbeatable ‘Tempo’ 
and if and when we are able to pull it off in the alumni it fills our chests with pride.</p>

Students' Alumni Cell reconnects the institute and alumni, providing the alumni with an avenue to give back to their alma mater. The Institution Development Program (IDP) aims to promote the institute's domestic ranking while simultaneously improving the international stature. The Batch Endowment program lets a batch adopt a certain construction in the institute to ensure its fluid working over the years. Bringing to the fore the ever present Hall tempo, the Hall Endowment program lets the Halls bring in infrastructural improvements and amenities to the Hall.
Utilising the massive alumni network of IIT Kharagpur, Students' Alumni Cell helps propel the institute to the pinnacle of education.</p>
