<p> The Students’ Alumni Cell works towards ensuring mutual benefit of the Students as well as the Alumni.
 The cell helps the alumni in staying connected to the institute. Through regular interactions with the next generation of KGPians, 
 the alumni too get to learn a lot as learning is a continuous process and each generation has their own set of skills to boast of. 
 The cell’s efforts keeps the ever-growing pool of bright, young KGPian minds at hand’s reach of the alumni for them to choose if and when they 
 require for any of their corporate endeavours. The Students’ Alumni Cell strives to rekindle those memories, revive that unbeatable ‘Tempo’ 
 and if and when we are able to pull it off in the alumni it fills our chests with pride.</p>
