					IIT-KGP has a long and historic legacy of Alumni Giving Back which has existed in one or the other form.
					The Graduating Class Gift is yet another chapter to be added in KGP alumni legacy initiated under My Imprint Program.
					It is a class-based effort directed towards raising unrestricted fund partially used currently and partially going towards Endowment. 
					This particular part of the Endowment would again be utilized for students' services only. It is an opportunity for graduating students 
					to take their first step in being soon-to-be alumni by making their Graduating Class Gift, the gift which impacts student life in the KGP
					campus. This challenge offers seniors the chance not only to make a gift, but also to leave behind their imprint
					As the My Imprint Program says, "By the students, For the Students", the following 9 options have been formulated by My Imprint Class Gift
					Committee, comprising of students only. Please click on The Committee tab to see the names of committee members.
					The 9 options have been categorized in 3 slabs, according to the sign-ups raised by the Class of 2015 at the end of campaigning. 
					You may make your choice of Class Gift in every slab. So, vote for 3 class gifts, one in each slab.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
