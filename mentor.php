		The Student Alumni Mentorship programme was started in session 2010-11 by the Students’ Alumni Cell
		as an initiative to create a platform for the exchange of ideas and experience between the alumni and 
		the current students of IIT Kharagpur.
		With an ocean of possibilities available, students often find it difficult to decide their way out
		into the future. There are lots of instances where students need a mentor who can counsel and guide 
		them through. The alumni can improve students' insight into various aspects of life. Their journey 
		and personal experiences can help the students and motivate them through this pivotal phase of life.
		Under this programme, we invite our alumni from across the world and from different fields to interact
		with the students and help them build their network and gain new perspective on the possibilities open
		to them after graduation.
